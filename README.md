### Hello fellow

I'm Karl, Karl Marx (not a joke), a backend developer from São Paulo, Brazil. My main work now are related to NodeJS, majorly with web-based services, but i really enjoy C++ and topics related to infrastructure.

If you want to see my for fun projects checkout the repositories. I have a website too: [karls.dev](https://karls.dev) (portuguese), with a much more professional introduction (but with some easter eggs, the console works on desktop, try roll command).
